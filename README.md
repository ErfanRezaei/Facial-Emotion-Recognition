# Facial Emotion Recognition

This project implements a deep learning model to recognize and classify 7 basic human emotions using the well-known **FER2013** dataset. The model is a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** built with the TensorFlow/Keras framework.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

This project utilizes the [FER2013] dataset, originally published for a Kaggle competition. The dataset consists of over 35,000 grayscale images of faces, each 48x48 pixels in size. The images are labeled with one of the following 7 emotion categories:

- **0**: Angry
- **1**: Disgust
- **2**: Fear
- **3**: Happy
- **4**: Sad
- **5**: Surprise
- **6**: Neutral
